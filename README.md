# lui-cogs
Custom cogs for [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot).  Deployed on the SFU Anime Club Discord bot that is running an instance of Red.  Feel free to submit issues regarding functionality improvements.

# Additional Requirements
- `catgirl`, `kanna` requires backend access for image approval (in-bot approval/adding images is a WIP). Will add a method to update image database via a download from this repo.
- `rss` requires BeautifulSoup.
- `ranks` requires MySQLdb, and an SQL script that creates the necessary tables and stored procedures used in the cog.
